============================================
A living systematic review

Short url: http://openmetaanalysis.github.io/Diabetes-prevention

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that clinical intervention *is* effective. Heterogeneity of results as measured by I<sup>2</sup> '[might not be important](http://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/chapter_9/9_5_2_identifying_and_measuring_heterogeneity.htm)' at 26%. This review updates previously published meta-analysis(es).(citation[s] below)

Meta-regression of common modulators (year of publication, study size, event rate in the control groups) finds that the outcome of the intervention is effected by xx.
